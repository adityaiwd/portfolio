This website is my final project for GoAcademy's workshop which is #LearnAtHome2nd. So the assignment is to create a clone out of zomato, basically it shows a list of restaurants or FnB places in a city and also we could search them too. I don't have much time to style this assignment, so I used Material UI to make things easier.
