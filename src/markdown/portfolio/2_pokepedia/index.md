A simple pokédex website that could catch a pokemon. This site is made with nextjs so it could do some server side rendering and also with apollo to connect to the graphql server. This site has an infinite scroll feature so the user can easily see the next page of the pokemons. Also this site uses indexeddb to store all of the pokemons that the users caught to their browser.
