I’m **Wicak**, a 21 years old junior year “Information Technology” student who happens to be a **front-end developer** as well, from Bogor City, West Java, Indonesia.  
<br />
In class I learn alot about basic and advanced programming in java. But at my sophomore year, seeing my other colleagues knows more about web or mobile development makes me think that the knowledge that I got from class is not enough. So aside from learning programming and other stuff in class, I improve my web and mobile development skills from projects, online courses, and joined a community of student developers in my faculty which is BCC (Basic Computing Community).  <br /> <br />
I’m very interested in front-end development because we get to create the bridge between the user and the app, other than that I find it satisfying to see the final product. So I took some courses that’s about front-end development such as [Advanced CSS and SASS](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/) , [The Complete 2020 Web development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) , [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/), and also my friends at BCC taught me some stuff not only about advanced front-end stuff but some about backend too.  
<br />
Because we know the best way to learn is to practice, I also did a bunch of personal projects with the knowledge I gathered from the courses, you can check them on my <scroll to="portfolio" smooth={true}>portfolio</scroll>.
